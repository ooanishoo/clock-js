# **Analog Clock**

This is a simple analog clock implemented using HTML, CSS, and Vanilla JavaScript. The clock displays the current time with hour, minute, and second hands.

## **Motivation:**

In the age of powerful frameworks and libraries, it's easy to overlook the beauty and simplicity of Vanilla JavaScript. Sometimes, it's important to take a step back and revisit the foundational concepts that underpin our everyday work. By creating this analog clock, I was able to refresh my understanding of basic Â HTML, CSS, and JavaScript concepts.

## Usage:

To use the analog clock in your project, follow these steps:

1.  Download or clone this repository to your local machine.
2.  Open the **index.html** file in a web browser.
3.  Voila! The analog clock should now be displayed on the page, showing the current time.

Feel free to explore the code and make modifications according to your needs. Experiment with different styles and customize the clock to fit your project's requirements.
